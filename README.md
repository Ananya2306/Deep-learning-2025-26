# ML PROJECT

## Face Mask Detection

This project focuses on detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

The system detects a face from an image or live video feed and classifies it into:

Mask

No Mask

The goal of this project was to understand the end-to-end ML workflow — from data preprocessing and model training to real-time prediction.

## Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

NumPy

## Working

Face is detected using OpenCV.

The detected face region is extracted and preprocessed.

The trained CNN model predicts whether a mask is present.

The result is displayed on the image/video feed in real time.
